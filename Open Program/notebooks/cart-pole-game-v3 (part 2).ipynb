Today, You will read how I attempt to create a model that learns by only uses being alive as reward. We will try to look steps into the future whilst playing (and look steps back while training). I made this into a new document since the last one was super messy where i declared the same function over 6 times and it was made in the middle of the night so screw that.

Regarding rewards, we will give the action done 5 frames ago a fixed reward of 0, if it survives we can change this reward to 1. if it doesnt survive, last 5 moves will all get a reward of 0.

Right now we just throw away the last 6 states and last 6 actions before we die. What we could do is try to invert the last 6 actions and save it as data. sounds good right? lets try that"

    "we can conclude that the more a model is trained, the better it performs. Are the pole methods better than the frame methods? in the short term yes, but if the frame models get trained as much as the pole models they will definitely crush the pole models. the problem is that they train very slow (in 10000 games they learn 33 new states). This is my bad because the reward system on the frame method is just bad. So they idea of the frame method is very neat, but poorly executed. Instead of trying to improve I will leave it off here. It was a very cool adventure, and definitely learned lots of cool things."
