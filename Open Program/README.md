# Open Program

## Brawlhalla AI
The initial plan of my Open Program was to make progress in the Brawlhalla AI project (trying to use Reinforcement Learning). This didn't really workout due to very stupid and less stupid error I ran into. Instead of using Reinforcement Learning for Brawlhalla, I tried using it for the Cart Pole Game. I ran into the same stupid errors so I stopped and just left it and decided to not deliver anything for my Open Project, untill...

## Cart Pole Game
I was so frustrated because I understood all the theory behind Reinforcement Learning, but the code just wouldn't work for me. (I later found out why it didn't work. I tried using an older version of tensorflow on a very new version of python, but that won't work. You will have to downgrade python in for example a virtual environment but I wasn't thinking this much at the time). So I decided to write my own self-learning algorithm. this was pretty much a succes.
