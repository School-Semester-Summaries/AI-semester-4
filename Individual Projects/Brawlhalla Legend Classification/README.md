# Project explained in short
After dropping my initial project, I was left with a very wide domain understanding. Since I
didnâ€™t want to throw my domain understanding away and do everything all over again, I
decided to do something else involving the topic Brawlhalla. I looked on our school website
for machine learning exercises, took an easy pokemon-classification exercise, and shaped it
like my own application. I realised I could do the exact same thing for the playable
characters in Brawlhalla plus this way I would touch all the learning outcomes so it looked
like a safe move. School was already using a machine learning algorithm (Support Vector
Machines) in their pokemon-classification. But to expand the application, I tried out a
different machine learning algorithm as well (Neirest Neighbours)

## Beloved Reader
I worked on this project after my semester as well. So for less of a school version of everything you can visit this repository -> [BLC Repo](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/Brawlhalla-Legend-Classification)
