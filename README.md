# Preface
In this semester I got an introduction to AI. Everything that I have done this semester is explained in my [PDR]. Looking for the work itself, don't worry it will also be mentioned below.

# Semester structure
As you can see in the image below, the first 12 weeks is 4 days individual project, 1 day group project. After these weeks, we have 4 weeks group project. In the end we have 2 weeks Open Program. Open program isn't the same for everyone. If you hit every section inside Machine Learning, DAIA (idk what this stands for ðŸ˜­) and Societal Impact sufficiently, you can do whatever you want in these 2 weeks. If not, you could choose between 2 exexrcises.
