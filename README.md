  # Preface
  Introduction to the semester and a little background on you. (~100 words)
  
  # Learning Outcomes
  A chapter per learning outcome, in which per PDR evaluation:
- a self-assessment stating at what level of progression (see learning level scale), you believe you currently are for this learning outcome.
- a learning process description that supports your self-evaluation (why do you believe you have reached the above-mentioned level?), and the received feedback and marks (make screenshots) from the teachers and fellow students. Add a personal reflection on the received feedback (what do you think of it, and what did you do with it?). Refrain from adding full pieces of work that can also be found in Canvas, link to them if need be.

wip

followed the following tutorial

https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html

this helped me with my challenge, it teched me how to get started with live custom object detection.

in the next video someone uses ai to create a bot in smash this game is very simular to the game im making a bot for so this might be pretty useful.

### Iteration 0
So for iteration 0 i made an entire document around Object Detection combined with Reinforcement Learning. The idea was to train an object detection model to generate game data, and feed this game data to the reinforcement learning model. The conclusion of iteration 0 was that this might be a risky project since it might take a lot of time to actually realize. I did manage to find a shortcut for the gamedata using object tracking. But this object tracking was detecting moving pixels removing all data from my project entirely. For that reason i decided to just drop the project enitrely.

  ## Learning Outcome 1: Data preparation
  
  Made 'Introduction to Data Provisioning' didn't get feedback yet
  
  ## Learning Outcome 2: Data analysis & model engineering
  
  made exercise 1 *Neirest Neighbours* discussed my answers with Qin, my machine learning teacher, in class. Also did she give me some feedback on canvas 
  
  **Feedback Qin Zhao**

  I applied all her feedback. (do i show images of my code or something?)
  
  ## Learning Outcome 3: Reliability and transparency
  
  ## Learning Outcome 4: Targeted interaction
  
  ## Learning Outcome 5: Future orientation
  
  ## Learning Outcome 6: Investigative problem solving
  
  ### Exercises
made exercise 1 *Research Based Learning* with lars esther skylar nikola. In the exercise we prepared a research about reinforcement learning. The main question     was: Is Reinforcement Learning suitable to create practice bots in Brawlhalla? We presented the research to the AI classes and John. As feedback we got the following

**Feedback Nick Welman**

After this feedback we decided to take out sub questions that don't help answering the main question. Also did we change 'Sub Quests' to 'Sub Questions'

made exercise 2 *Domain Understanding* with Edin K. no feedback yet
  
  ## Learning Outcome 7: Personal leadership
  
  ## Learning Outcome 8: Internship Preparation
  
 # Retrospective
 Retrospect (only in the final version) (~200 words)
What do you think of the course in general, and your role in it. Also feel free to elaborate on the things that you "would do differently next time" as this implies experience in the subject and insight in your learning.
 
 # Conclusion
 Conclusion (only in the final version) (~100 words)
Why do you believe you have succeeded this course?

 # Appendixes
  Add only appendixes that you actually reference in the document. There is no need to add pieces of work to the appendix if they can be found in Canvas already.
