# Preface
Starting this semester I had basically 0 experience with AI. It always looked so interesting to me but I have never done anything with it. Previous semesters I have followed software demand based. I mainly have been making games in my semesters, keeping in mind i have to touch all learning outcomes. For if you're wondering why I didn't choose gamedesign. Gamedesign would look like the perfect specialisation to me, would probably be really fun but I don't think the future in gamedesign is too big.
  
# Learning Outcomes

### Iteration 0
So for iteration 0 i made an entire document around Object Detection combined with Reinforcement Learning. The idea was to train an object detection model to generate game data, and feed this game data to the reinforcement learning model. The conclusion of iteration 0 was that this might be a risky project since it might take a lot of time to actually realize. I did manage to find a shortcut for the gamedata using object tracking. But this object tracking was detecting moving pixels removing all data from my project entirely. For that reason i decided to just drop the project enitrely.

## Learning Outcome 1: Data preparation
  
### Self Assessment 1
Untill now I have prepared a image dataset that I collected myself. To clean the data I have made a small checklist formyself. The steps were as following, Collect Data -> Convert to JPG 24bit-depth -> Resize to 2048x2048. These aren't just random steps, I have found out what to do in a lengthy trial and error process and with some help from Qin (my machine learning teacher). So in the end, I would say I can clean a dataset but in my opinion I'd say I have to do it at least one more time on an actual dataset, not with an image dataset.

## Learning Outcome 2: Data analysis & model engineering
  
### Self Assessment 1
In the Neirest Neighbours exercise I put my coding skills to the test and improved the code in the document. By improving the code it became much quicker to solve the given problems. My machine learning teacher liked my way of working and replied to my exercise,

As you can see I also got some feedback from her. I realised all this feedback and resubmitted the notebook.

Also in my challenge have I been working with models. Right now I am mainly focussing on Support Vector Machines (SVM). I used SVM for a classification problem. I visualised the results of my model in a heatmap. There you can see the results in a confusion matrix like scheme.

 ## Learning Outcome 3: Reliability and transparency

 ## Learning Outcome 4: Targeted interaction

 ## Learning Outcome 5: Future orientation

 ## Learning Outcome 6: Investigative problem solving

 ### Exercises
made exercise 1 *Research Based Learning* with lars esther skylar nikola. In the exercise we prepared a research about reinforcement learning. The main question     was: Is Reinforcement Learning suitable to create practice bots in Brawlhalla? We presented the research to the AI classes and John. As feedback we got the following

**Feedback Nick Welman**

After this feedback we decided to take out sub questions that don't help answering the main question. Also did we change 'Sub Quests' to 'Sub Questions'

made exercise 2 *Domain Understanding* with Edin K. no feedback yet

# Retrospective
Retrospect (only in the final version) (~200 words)
What do you think of the course in general, and your role in it. Also feel free to elaborate on the things that you "would do differently next time" as this implies experience in the subject and insight in your learning.

# Conclusion
Conclusion (only in the final version) (~100 words)
Why do you believe you have succeeded this course?

# Appendixes
 Add only appendixes that you actually reference in the document. There is no need to add pieces of work to the appendix if they can be found in Canvas already.
