# Preface
In this semester I got an introduction to AI. Everything that I have done this semester is summarised in my [Personal Developement Report (PDR)](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/AI-semester-4/blob/main/PDR_v4.3.pdf). Looking for all work on a specific project? It will be mentioned below.

# Semester structure
As you can see in the image below, the first 12 weeks is 4 days individual project, 1 day group project. After these weeks, we have 4 weeks group project. In the end we have 2 weeks Open Program. Open program isn't the same for everyone. If you hit every section inside Machine Learning, DAIA (idk what this stands for ðŸ˜­) and Societal Impact sufficiently, you can do whatever you want in these 2 weeks. If not, you could choose between 2 exexrcises.

# Individual Projects
This semester I first wanted to create a RL agent that could play Brawlhalla. This didn't really work out, so I did something easier. Image classification but with Brawlhalla Legends.

## Brawlhalla AI
I tried to create an Reinforcement Learning agent in Brawlhalla. In short, I didn't get that far.

## Brawlhalla Legend Classification
Inside this notebook we will classify brawlhalla legend images. Note: Only coded for 4 legends (easy to expand)

# Group Project
In our group project we worked on an application that could predict if there will be a traffic jam on the route you want to drive.

# Open Program
In my Open Program I wanted to make progress in my Brawlhalla AI project. I ended up making steps into Reinforcement Learning.

# Personal Developement Report
This is what the semester is all about. Your PDR is the only thing that will be graded in the end. It's quite a big document.

# Side Projects
The side projects are the projects I worked on during the semester but have nothing to do with my semester.

## Ranknir
This semester I continued on my discord bot called Ranknir. In short, Ranknir is a discord bot creates a Brawlhalla-leaderboard with a select group of people. The data is obtained using the game's API. I have built lots of new functionalities for Ranknir and Ranknir is now being used in 10 more servers bringing it to a total of 11 servers.

## Dadabase
(Dadabase is also a discord bot) One of the coolest functionalities I've built inside Ranknir, is that you can add console players into the elo lists. This is truly revolutionary since my bot is the only bot that is able to do this. But what is Dadabase, and how is it related? Via Dadabase you can add the players' ID's to a list. When Ranknir updates the elo list, it first asks Dadabase for the console players their ID's. In the end, this gives console players more the feeling that they are part of the clan. (since as if right now Brawlhalla clans are still exclusive to PC).

Dadabase makes it also possible to let Ranknir send the elo list for server members instead of clan members. (Also truly revolutionary)

# Epilogue
Looking back, it was really hard to get started with everything since I had 0 understanding of AI. In the end it was a really cool, fun and usefull semester. AI itself is the future. AI can be used for basically everything and can take over tasks humans usually would do. This means I can automate lots of processes so I don't have to do anything. AI is such a cool semester, don't miss out.
