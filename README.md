# Preface
Starting this semester I had basically 0 experience with AI. It always looked so interesting to me but I have never done anything with it. Previous semesters I have followed software demand based. I mainly have been making games in my semesters, keeping in mind i have to touch all learning outcomes. For if you’re wondering why I didn’t choose game design. Game design would look like the perfect specialisation to me, would probably be really fun but I don’t think the future in game design is too big.
  
# Learning Outcomes
Per learning outcome I wrote a self-assessment and give myself a grade.

## Learning Outcome 1: Data preparation
  
### Self Assessment 1
Until now I have prepared an image dataset that I collected myself. To clean the data I have made a small checklist for myself. The steps were as follows, Collect Data -> Convert to JPG 24 bit-depth -> Resize to 2048x2048. These aren’t just random steps, I have found out what to do in a lengthy trial and error process and with some help from Qin (my machine learning teacher). 
About storing the dataset. Right now its just stored on my pc. Since this didn’t give any problems I don't think it's necessary to make use of any additional cloud storage.

So in the end, I would say I can clean a dataset but in my opinion I’d say I have to do it at least one more time on an actual dataset (not with an image dataset) just to prove the teachers I can really clean a dataset. but what i have done till now isn't bad.

## Learning Outcome 2: Data analysis & model engineering
  
### Self Assessment 1
In the Neirest Neighbours exercise I put my coding skills to the test and improved the code in the document. By improving the code it became much quicker to solve the given problems. My machine learning teacher liked my way of working and replied to my exercise,

As you can see I also got some feedback from her. I realised all this feedback and resubmitted the notebook.

Also in my challenge have I been working with models. Right now I am mainly focussing on Support Vector Machines (SVM). I used SVM for a classification problem. I visualised the results of my model in a heatmap. There you can see the results in a confusion matrix like scheme.
  
_Grade - Beginning_

## Learning Outcome 3: Reliability and transparency
 
### Self Assessment 1
So the subject of my project is Brawlhalla. I"ve been playing this game for 5 years, have been coding Brawlhalla bots, repeatedly reporting bugs and I've been very active in the community. Like this you slowly you feel like you understand everything about the game. But still, still I tried to understand more about my domain. This is where I think I really shine. My teacher also thought so.

Whilst exploring my domain I found some subjects you can't easily get to know more about. For these subjects I will do an interview with a Brawlhalla modder over discord.

 ## Learning Outcome 4: Targeted interaction
???

 ## Learning Outcome 5: Future orientation
The societal impact of my own challenging is rather low. I'm using multiple models to see which one performs best for my problem. This way I can optimalise performace for my project.

*Grade - Orienting*

 ## Learning Outcome 6: Investigative problem solving
With a group of students we made the exercise *Research Based Learning* In the exercise we prepared a research about reinforcement learning. The main question     was: Is Reinforcement Learning suitable to create practice bots in Brawlhalla? We presented the research to the AI classes and John. As feedback we got the following

After this feedback we decided to take out sub questions that don't help answering the main question. Also did we change 'Sub Quests' to 'Sub Questions'

Also did I make the exercise *Domain Understanding* with another student as comment we got

*Grade - Beginning*

## Learning Outcome 7: Personal leadership

### Self Assessment 1
So in the begin of the semester I wanted to create a Brawlhalla bot using reinforcement learning. I couldn't reach the game source code, so to solve it i walso wanted to make an object detection tool. the object detection tool would generate the needed game data in realtime by looking at the the screen. This sounded like such a cool project but after 2/3 weeks of working on it I realised it wasn't working out. It was possible to realise but not for me in this given time with my experience. Here's a comment from my teacher about tihe subject

Everyday I am at school ontime. If I'm not I always let my teachers know, as fast as possible, how much later I will be at school. By keeping the teachers up to date with my absence I keep my profesional skills on a high level. Here a few examples.

**Example 1**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/196382203-e9f4f066-502b-4be4-83e7-d0582896e0c3.png)

**Example 2**

Absence is just a part of the profesional skills. Also do i try to communicate with the teachers alot to make sure everything is going alright / i understand everything correctly 

**Example 3**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/196383371-5fbd8c71-2c0d-430e-badc-aff00cc6c12a.png)

**Example 4**

**Example 5**

If i keep it up like it is going now I believe I will get a good grade for this learning outcome

_Grade - Advanced_
